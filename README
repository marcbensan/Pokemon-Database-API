# WEB322_TEST3

This test was pretty straightforward from beginning to the end, especially after watching the lecture video plus reading the WEB322 module. I am not so proud of the design choice that I made. I was trying my best to contain all my scripts in a separate index.js but somehow I keep encountering the problem "http://localhost:8080/api/data/index.js NOT FOUND". I tried multiple possible solutions to go around it but I resulted to just defining my methods in a </script> tag. However, I am pretty proud on the fact that I managed to come up with a solution that only required two functions. I tried incorporating the concept of function overloading I learned from C++
and it somehow worked in my favour. I initially finished the project with three methods but seeing that the methods for displaying the results are very similar, I knew there had to be a way to achieve the desired outcome with less functions. Overall, this test enabled me to broaden my knowledge in express and also allowed me to experiment by combining concepts I have learned from other courses.
